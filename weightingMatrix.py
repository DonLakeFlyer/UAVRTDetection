def weightingMatrix(x_of_n_in: np.ndarray, Fs: float, zetas: np.ndarray, frequencyRangeType:str):
    # WEIGHTINGMATRIX Builds the spectral weighting matrix for the incoherent
    # summationation algorithm. The matrix is based on the DFT coefficients
    # developed from the waveform passed to the function. The function first
    # developeds a weighting vectors based on an unaltered waveform, but then
    # shifts the waveforms spectral content base fractions of the DFT bin width,
    # as defined by the zetas input. These shifted waveforms then have their
    # DFT's computed. The original and shifted DFT coefficients are then aligned
    # in a matrix. In this way, this weighting matrix allows for the dominant
    # frequency in the vector it weights to be between bins. This submatrix is
    # then row shifted and concantinated a number of times so that the DFT
    # coefficients are shifted across all DFT frequency bins. The outputs are 
    # the weighting matrix W and a frequency vector Wf that corresponds to the 
    # rows of W. The frequencies, and therefore the rows of the W matrix, use a
    # centered frequency definitions defined by the STFT.m algorithm. 
    # 
    #    Example:   [W,Wf] = weightingmatrix(rand(1,10),1,[0 0.5])
    #  
    #    INPUTS:
    #    x_of_n      nx1     Vector of discrete data sampled as Fs. Can be 1xn.
    #    Fs          1x1     Sampling rate in Hz of the dataset
    #    zetas       mx1     A vector of fractions of the DFT frequency bin
    #                        width for which to compute and include in the
    #                        spectral weighting matrix output. If no interbin
    #                        shifting is desired, enter 0. Range of inputs
    #                        [0,1).
    #    frequencyRangeType  String of either 'centered' or 'twosided'. See
    #                        stft.m documentation on details of these frequency
    #                        bounds. If 'centered' is selected, the zero
    #                        frequency point is near the center of the output
    #                        matrix. If 'twosided' is selected, the zero
    #                        frequency points is in the upper left corner of the
    #                        output W matrix. 
    # 
    #    OUTPUTS:
    #    W           nxnm    A matrix of spectral weighting vectors along each
    #                        column. The hermitian of this matrix is designed to
    #                        be multiplied by a vector of DFT coefficients. The 
    #                        weights held in column p can be thought of as the
    #                        matched DFT coefficients if the signal were to have
    #                        been shifted by the template by Wf(p). 
    #    Wf          nmx1    A matrix of the frequency shifts corresponding to
    #                        each column of W 
    # 
    # 
    #  The intended use of the W matrix is to multiply it's hermetian by a FFT 
    #  vector, or STFT matrix with frequencies in the rows. 
    #           
    # 
    #    [W^h]*S         or          [W^h]*FFT
    # 
    #  The outputs of this multiplication will have n*m rows. The rows of the
    #  result there for are the "scores" of at frequency associated with that
    #  row. The row frequencies are dependent on the zetas. Consider an input
    #  series that had frequencies [-100 0 100 200]. If the zeta input was 
    #  [0 0.5], weightings for full and half frequencies steps would be 
    #  developed.

    #                0       [            W^h            ]
    #                50      [                           ]
    #                100     [                           ]
    #                150     [                           ]

    #    The first row of the matrix above would contain the weightings for the
    #    -100 0 100 and 200 Hz frequencie bins if the FFT (or STFT time window)
    #    had a signal at -150 Hz. Similarly, the second row would contain the 
    #    weightings for the -100 0 100 and 200 Hz frequencie bins if the FFT 
    #    (or STFT time window) had a signal at -100 Hz.

    # #  Change Log
    #  2022-01-12    Updated to include twosided frequency range for output and
    #                updated the code associated with generating the unsorted W
    #                matrix to increase speed. Added use of makestftFreqVector
    #                function.
